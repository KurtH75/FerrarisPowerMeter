# FerrarisPowerMeter
A sensor for a ferraris power meter based on an ESP8266 or similar including a HomeAssistant-Integration via MQTT.

## Short Description
The general intention of this Arduino sketch is pretty straight forward: Read the rotations of the disc of a ferraris power meter and calculate the actual power consumption in watts and the energy consumption of the day and in total in kWh. Write all these informations on MQTT topics which are discovered from Home Assistant automatically.
